# Required Packages

In this project, we will use a number of amazing R packages:

-   `knitr`: to generate pretty tables of date using the `kable()`
    function.  
-   `tidyverse`: to manipulate data, generate plots (via `ggplot2`), and
    to use piping/chaining.  
-   `rmarkdown`: to knit output files manually using the `render()`
    function.  
-   `jsonlite`: to pull data from various endpoints of the Covid 19
    APIs.
